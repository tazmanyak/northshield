# North Shield
North Shield is my Sphere Server Ultima Online Game Server. I decided to publish all the content I scripted as developer and will continue developing on it. You can also develop the content, its public repository. This scripts are going to be and being used by many developers.

What you will see from this repository is the content of scripts existed in the my game engine. 
I'm still developing scripts and also hard-coded stuffs on Sphere Server where I'm developer and also work on closed-project Sphere Server Game Emulator.

If you want to participate in this project, you can simply ask me to do so. 




Main Sphere Server Web Site : http://spherecommunity.net => You can look at me by the nick as Avatar which is my nickname in the community.


This is only the scripting repository. As I mentioned before, since the sphere server is closed-project, it is not possible for now to publish in GIT as public repository. Even if I have permission to get source, it is not allowed to publish as public. Whenever it is going to be open-source, as developers, we will certainly share the content of project. For now, this is the best I can do for all developers.
