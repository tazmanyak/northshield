# North Shield
North Shield is my Sphere Server Ultima Online Game Server. I decided to publish all the content I scripted as developer and will continue developing on it. You can also develop the content, its public repository. This scripts is going to be and being used by many developers.

What you will see from this repository is the content of scripts existed in the game engine. 
I'm still developing scripts on Sphere Server where I'm developer and also work on closed-project Sphere Server Game Emulator
